# ComfyUI-Easy Color Corrector Project Goals

## Project Vision

 **ComfyUI-EasyColorCorrector** is a professional-grade, AI-powered color correction suite that democratizes advanced color grading for the ComfyUI ecosystem.

 That‚Äôs the fancy version.

 Real talk: I‚Äôm not trying to take over the color correction world. It‚Äôs just a node.

 I built it to bridge the gap between ‚ÄúAI, do the thing‚Äù and ‚Äúlet me tweak this like I‚Äôm grading a Netflix series.‚Äù

 If it helps artists, creators, and chaos-powered ComfyUI users get better color without paying Adobe or wiring 12 nodes together? Mission accomplished.

 If not‚Ä¶ hey, at least now you have histograms.

## Core Objectives

### 1. **AI-Powered Automation**
Make professional color grading accessible through intelligent automation that understands content, lighting, and artistic intent.

### 2. **Artistic Content Focus**
Specialize in enhancing concept art, anime, illustrations, and stylized content while maintaining excellent photographic support.

### 3. **Real-Time Workflow Integration**
Seamlessly integrate with ComfyUI workflows with instant feedback and visual analysis tools.
