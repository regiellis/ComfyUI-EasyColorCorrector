> [!NOTE]
> **Disclaimer**: I'm obviously joking about the "$1000+ plugin" claims and competing with Photoshop - this is a ComfyUI custom node, not industry software! 😄 **BUT** it does have legit AI-powered features, face detection, and professional color science. And hey, it beats paying Adobe! 💰

## 🚀 What is this?
 **ComfyUI-EasyColorCorrector** *is a professional-grade, AI-powered color correction suite that democratizes advanced color grading for the ComfyUI ecosystem.*

**That’s the fancy version.**

**Real talk:** I’m not trying to take over the color correction world. It’s just a node.

 I built it to bridge the gap between **“AI, *do the thing*”** and **“let me tweak this like I’m grading a Netflix series.”**
If it helps artists, creators, and chaos-powered ComfyUI users get better color without paying Adobe or wiring 12 nodes together? Mission accomplished.

If not… hey, at least now you have histograms.


**This node is *opinionated* about color science** - it leverages computer vision, perceptual color spaces, and advanced algorithms to deliver results that rival industry-standard color grading tools.

### 🤯 The TL;DR

- **🤖 AI-Powered**: Face detection, scene analysis, content-aware enhancement
- **🎨 Professional**: LAB color space, 3-way color correction, perceptual curves  
- **⚡ Real-time**: Selective node execution for instant feedback
- **🎛️ Three Modes**: Auto (AI magic), Preset (curated looks), Manual (full control)

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Add **"Easy Color Correction"** node to your workflow
2. Connect an image input
3. Choose your mode:
   - **Auto**: Enable AI analysis and let it work its magic
   - **Preset**: Pick a style and optionally enable AI adaptation
   - **Manual**: Full control with professional tools
4. **Connect outputs as needed**:
   - Main **image output** → Save Image or further processing
   - **Histogram output** → Preview Image (to see RGB analysis)
   - **Palette output** → Preview Image (to see color swatches)
   - **Palette data** → Text nodes or other color-aware nodes

### 📊 **Enabling Visual Analysis**

Enable **"Extract Palette"** to generate:
- ✅ RGB histogram visualization
- ✅ Color palette extraction and visualization  
- ✅ Dominant color analysis in console
- ✅ Advanced K-means clustering

When disabled, histogram and palette outputs will be black images.

- **Manual Mode auto-disables AI** for pure manual control (can re-enable if needed)
- **Preset sliders update automatically** showing exactly what the preset does
- **White Balance**: -1.0 = cooler/blue, +1.0 = warmer/orange (professional range)
- **Temperature & Tint**: Separate controls in Manual mode for professional color grading
- **Face detection works best** with clear, well-lit portraits
- **Try presets first**, then fine-tune with manual controls
- **Enable Extract Palette** to see histogram and color analysis
- **Use Reference Image** for mood board color matching
- **Connect histogram/palette outputs** to Preview Image nodes for visual feedback
